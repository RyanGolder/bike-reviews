## Description
The Bike Reviews App is a web application that allows users to share their thoughts and reviews on road, gravel, and mountain bikes with the cycling community. This forum gives people the opportunity to hear from honest people who ride their bike and aren't getting paid for the review like large media companies. With a lot of reviews out there at the moment there is clear bias and an inability to point out flaws in fear of backlash from the bike companies.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the app securely using their email and password. Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Create and Read Reviews: Authenticated users can write and publish reviews for various bike models, sharing their experiences and insights with the community. Users can also browse through existing reviews.
- Profile Page: Users have access to their personalized profile page, where they can view and manage their submitted reviews.
